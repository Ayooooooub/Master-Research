## Keywords
- Asteroidea : other term for tarfish in latin means star.
- Macrobenthos : refers to the organisms living on or in the bottom sediments of a water body that are large enough to be visible to the naked eye, typically exceeding 1 mm in size.
- Meiobenthos : those animals retained by a 0.1–1.0-mm-mesh sieve.
- Echinoderm : any animal of the phylum Echinodermata, which includes starfish, brittle stars, sea urchins, sand dollars and sea cucumbers, as well as the sessile sea lilies or "stone lilies".
- Mechanoreception : the sensory process that enables an organism to detect and respond to mechanical stimuli, such as touch, pressure, vibration, and sound.
- Chemoreception : the physiological process by which organisms detect and respond to chemical stimuli in their environment.
- Chemosensory-mediated : describes processes or phenomena that are influenced or mediated by the chemosensory system, which is responsible for detecting chemical stimuli in the environment.
- Rheotaxis : the ability of an organism to orient itself in response to a current of water or air.
- Behavioral bilateralism : the focus on two-party interactions and relationships between states, as opposed to multilateral or unilateral approaches.
- Planktonic organisms : aquatic organisms, primarily microscopic, that drift passively in water or are weakly swimming and unable to move against strong currents.
- Starfish larvae : tiny, planktonic organisms that hatch from eggs and spend a period drifting in the ocean before transforming into adult starfish.
- Sessile marine invertebrates : animals without backbones that are permanently attached to a substrate, like rocks or reefs, in the marine environment.
- Ossicles : internal skeleton made of hard plates called ossicles, which are composed of calcium carbonate.

## Books about sea star (marine biology)
- *Starfish: Biology and Ecology of the Asteroidea* by John M. Lawrence**

This comprehensive volume offers an in-depth look at the biology and ecology of starfish, covering topics such as reproduction, development, and ecological roles. It serves as an excellent reference for understanding the integrative and comparative aspects of starfish biology.([Barnes & Noble][1])

- *Starfishes of the Atlantic* by Ailsa M. Clark and Maureen E. Downey**

A classic in the field, this book provides detailed descriptions and illustrations of starfish species found in the Atlantic Ocean. It's particularly useful for species identification and understanding the diversity within this group.

- *Sea Stars of British Columbia, Southeast Alaska, and Puget Sound* by Philip Lambert**

Focusing on the northwestern coast of North America, this handbook describes 43 species and subspecies of sea stars. It's an excellent resource for regional studies and offers insights into the diverse habitats these creatures occupy.([shop.royalbcmuseum.bc.ca][2])

- *A Field Guide to Sea Stars and Other Echinoderms of Galapagos* by Cleveland P. Hickman Jr.**

This compact field guide is ideal for those interested in the echinoderms of the Galapagos Islands. It includes detailed information on various species, making it a handy reference for fieldwork and ecological studies.([AbeBooks][3])

- *Under the Sea-Wind* by Rachel Carson**

While not exclusively about sea stars, this poetic work by renowned marine biologist Rachel Carson offers vivid descriptions of marine life, including starfish. It provides a broader context of the marine ecosystem and the interconnectedness of its inhabitants.([metrofieldguide.com][4])

- *The Edge of the Sea* by Rachel Carson**

Another masterpiece by Carson, this book explores the rich and diverse life along the Atlantic seashore. It delves into the habitats of various marine organisms, offering insights that can enhance your understanding of sea stars within their ecosystems.
