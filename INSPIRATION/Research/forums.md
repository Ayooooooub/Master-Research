**Question**
* Muscle memory / How to input perfectly / Learn combos ?

General Question
Hey,
Recently i tried to learn my first combo, the luigi 0-to-death.
I had to deal with annoying things like how consistently short hop, fast fall aerial, buffer moves..
I read a lot of threads about how to input correctly in this game because it seems so hard imo (i have 1 month exp on the game, and it's my first fighter battle game, never touched tekken, street, previous smash, etc.). Actually with 3 hours a day since 6 days training, i can get the combo for like 5-10% of my tries at best. Every 10-15 fails, i maybe get a successfull combo (in training mode).

It's very bad. I heard about muscle memory. For me, it doesn't work for now, but it's only 6 days. Sometimes i feel like during 3 days, there's no progress, and my practice is somewhat useless. Despite this, do you have any advices for people who want to learn complex combos or moves (like RAR, etc.) ?

As just an example of how bad can be a beginner, i let you know that even with the short hop macro, i sometimes can't short hop. Because like piano beginners, sometimes my left and right hands are just not synchronised (i use right/left triggers as jump buttons, i don't want X because i have same success rate with it but it take my thumb busy so bad deal). Even if i would use X + ZR or some trigger, sometimes my fingers in the same hand are just not synchronized xD

Waiting for advices to not be in a painful state everytime i'll want to learn a combo in this game, ty

**Answers**
1. * Watch as many YouTube videos as you can, play as much as you can (friendlies with people in person, elite smash, battle arenas, etc.) While also spending as much time in the training mode as possible; make sure you're practicing with intent ("today im gonna focus on juggling reactively") even in the training room ("today im gonna nail this fastfall timing").

2. * There's something i think a lot of people underestimate imo. It's the importance of theory. Imo, practice 1000 hours with braindead or very limited ideas in brain could drive this person to be worst than someone who'd took 100 hours to theory craft and discuss on reddit/discord about every little part of the game, and then just practice 100 hours, 200 total.

By example, i'm on luigi discord, and if i was only practicing the combo again and again, i'll be there in 1 month with a bad combo success rate. But because i spammed them of questions, i got very detailed things like i can buffer some moves, some others not, sometimes it's better to delay some moves, etc.

You can also consider this "i need informations" part as a part of the practice itself because you said "watch videos". That's why i made this thread, searching for those little things, advices that some people will be able to give, and that'll save a lot of my time.

3. * I learned all my inputs rar, wavebounce, b-reverse, etc. by going into training mode and slowing the game down to half speed. Then I slowly increased the speed once I had the inputs down.

4. * It just takes time and practice. Even after 100h in the game I still felt like a total beginner tbh. I didn't learn how to properly short hop without 2 jump buttons for ages. The trick that ended up working for me tho was to think about releasing the jump button as fast as possible and not pressing it as fast as possible.

5. * Practice more until you can't get it wrong
