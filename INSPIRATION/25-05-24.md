# Master Thesis Subject
The Starfish and the Self: Somatic Intelligence and decentralized embodiment through the case of Starfish
The Starfish is the means by which all is revealed

## First Intents:
Still interested in the themes of muscle memory/procedural memory and embodiment in human beings, I would like to explore them from a new angle. The behavior and unique radial symmetry of the sea star/starfish offer a compelling case for comparison with humans. Unlike us, sea stars function without a centralized brain, distributing their sensory and motor systems throughout their limbs. This decentralized structure, along with their ability to move, sense, and respond through multiple points of control, piqued my curiosity.

For human beings, muscle memory often feels intuitive and innate, our bodies "remember" the set movements even when our conscious attention drifts. This raises questions about where memory and control actually reside in the body. How much of our physical awareness is truly centralized, and how much is distributed across our nervous and muscular systems? By observing how sea stars interact with their environment, coordinate movement, and recover from injury without a clear ‚Äúcenter,‚Äù I hope to draw parallels to the human experience of embodiment, how we perceive our bodies, learn physical tasks, and internalize movement over time.

- Muscle memory, often termed procedural memory in scientific contexts, is a form of implicit memory that enables individuals to perform tasks without conscious awareness of the learned skills.
- Asteroidea defines a class of echinoderms commonly known as starfish or sea stars. These animals are characterized by their radial symmetry, typically with five or more arms radiating from a central disk. They also possess a water vascular system, which is crucial for locomotion, feeding, and gas exchange.


## The question :
- How does the morphology of starfish support alternative forms of body intelligence, and how might these inform somatic or sensorimotor patterns in human neuromuscular behavior?

- Can the case of the starfish reframe our understanding of the ‚Äúself‚Äù as something distributed rather than centralized?

- How does comparing decentralized motor coordination in starfish with human muscle memory alter our understanding of embodied learning?

## Abstract (Example)
This thesis explores the embodied experience of muscle memory through the metaphor and physiology of the starfish‚Äîa creature with no centralized brain, radial symmetry, and the ability to regenerate. Drawing from somatic practices, phenomenology, and posthuman theory, the research questions dominant human-centric models of physicality and cognition, which often privilege upright, dualistic, and brain-led systems of knowing.

By examining the starfish as a speculative model of embodied intelligence, the project reimagines the distribution of memory, awareness, and movement across the whole body. Through interviews, sensory exercises, and artistic exploration, the thesis investigates how people relate to their bodies' "automatic" knowledge, and how decentralized, non-linear modes of embodiment might open up new understandings of self, identity, and interaction.

The project proposes that muscle memory is not merely mechanical repetition, but a living, sensing archive one that might be rethought through softness, radiality, and regeneration.

## Key Themes
Muscle Memory as Living Archive
Moving beyond mechanical repetition to explore the emotional, spatial, and historical dimensions of bodily knowledge.
Decentralized Embodiment
Challenging the brain-body binary by asking what it means to ‚Äúknow‚Äù something with your limbs, skin, or balance system.
Radial Symmetry and Nonlinear Perception
Using the starfish to question how spatial orientation shapes cognition, movement, and self-conception.
Regeneration and Somatic Time
Exploring healing, adaptation, and bodily change not as return-to-norm but as creative, embodied reconfiguration.
Posthuman and More-than-Human Bodies
Using the starfish to unsettle anthropocentric assumptions of movement, memory, and ‚Äúproper‚Äù bodies.


## Interviews

### üß† 1. **Memory + Movement Questions**

Get people to reflect on how their body remembers or reacts without thinking.

* Can you think of something your body ‚Äújust knows how to do,‚Äù even if you haven‚Äôt done it in a while? (e.g. riding a bike, typing, swimming)
* How do you feel when your body does something automatically? Do you feel in control‚Äîor like it‚Äôs happening *through* you?
* Have you ever tried to *unlearn* a movement or habit your body was used to? What did that feel like?

---

### ü´Ä 2. **Bodily Awareness + Perception**

These prompt people to notice parts of their body or how they sense space.

* Do you ever become aware of a part of your body only when it *hurts* or *moves wrong*?
* Are there parts of your body you tend to forget about or not ‚Äúfeel‚Äù often?
* How do you usually sense what‚Äôs behind you, or around you, without turning to look?

---

### üåä 3. **Flow, Coordination, and Touch**

Useful if you're thinking about distributed or multi-point sensing like a starfish.

* Have you ever done something that made you feel like your whole body was moving as one (like dancing, surfing, climbing)?
* Can you describe what it feels like to be in water? How is that different from walking or sitting?
* If your body could sense more *with your skin*, or *with your limbs*, what do you imagine that would feel like?

---

### üåü 4. **Starfish-Specific Speculation (tie-in to your metaphor)**

Introduce the metaphor once they‚Äôre comfortable.

* Starfish don‚Äôt have a brain in the center. Imagine if your limbs could ‚Äúthink‚Äù for themselves‚Äîhow do you think your experience of the world would change?
* If your body were shaped like a starfish‚Äîno clear front or back, just five limbs‚Äîhow would you move differently? Would your sense of self change?
* Starfish can grow back limbs. What would it mean for you to lose a part of yourself and grow it back again?
